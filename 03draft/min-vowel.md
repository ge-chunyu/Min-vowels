<!--abstract: "This chapter investigates vowels and diphthongs in two Southern Min Chinese dialects, Xiamen Southern Min Chinese in the homeland of Southern Min Chinese and Cangnan Southern Min Chinese in an enclave surrounded mainly by Wu Chinese. These two Southern Min varieties have some differences in phonological systems. Cangnan Min has lost the consonant codas and it has more monophthongs and diphthongs than Xiamen Min. This chapter first aims to illustrate the differences in phonological systems between the two varieties, and it also compares the phonetic implementation of vowels and in particular of diphthongs, in order to investigate the variations and commonalities of vowels and diphthongs in these two varieties."-->

# Introduction

A perennial debate in segmental phonology is whether diphthongs should be treated as composing two static units or one single dynamic unit. This study will investigate monophthongs and diphthongs in two closely related Southern Min Chinese dialects, Xiamen and Cangnan, attempting to contribute to the understanding of the cross-linguistic diversities of the phonological systems and phonetic implementation. The next section gives a brief review of cross-linguistic study of vowels and diphthongs.Section 1.2 briefly reviews the debate of characterising diphthongs as two static targets vs. one dynamic target. The introduction section ends with an overview of the two subject dialects in the present study, with a particular emphasis on the vowel system.

## Cross-linguistic studies of vowel

The cross-linguistic studies of vowel centres almost exclusively on monophthongs. Maddieson (1984) summarized several cross-linguistic tendencies of vowel systems based on the UPSID database. The cardinal vowels are the most frequently observed vowels cross-linguistically, and the most common vowel system is a five-vowel system. As for diphthongs, /ei ai au ou ui io/ are the most common diphthongs across languages. Another stream of research is the explanation and prediction of the possible vowel systems attested in human languages (see the review in Vaux and Samuels 2015). The most prominent theory is dispersion theory. One of the most fundamental principles of dispersion theory is that vowel contrasts should be easy enough to be distinguished, either via maximum contrast (Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972) or sufficient contrast (Lindblom 1986). Despite some further revision, dispersion theory still has some drawbacks that it cannot fully predict the possible vowel systems (Vaux and Samuels 2015).

One of the limitations in the studies and explanations on the previous studies is that usually only monophthongs are included in the inventory, disregarding diphthongs. There are a few cross-language studies of diphthongs. Lindau, Norlin and Svantesson (1990) compared the diphthongs /ai au/ in Arabic, Hausa, Chinese and English, and they found that the transciptionally equivalent diphthongs can have different timing of the diphthongal transitions in different languages. Mayr and Davies (2011) demonstrated that there are differences in the spectral dynamics of diphthongs even between closely related dialects (Northern and Southern Welsh). There is also a study which aims to incorporate diphthong into dispersion theory (Peterson 2015) base solely on English. These studies are sporadic and has not constitute a synergy in unveiling the nature of diphthong. On the other hand, since Hu (2013), he and colleagues investigated monophthongs and diphthongs extensively in Chinese dialects (see the review in Hu 2023 and references therein). An emerging typological trend is that rising diphthongs are more likely to have two targets, while falling diphthongs tend to be more dynamic with only one single unit. The present study will approach two varieties of Southern Min Chinese in this framework.

## The nature of diphthongs: Compositional vs. unitary

Despite the transcriptional convention of using two vowels to transcribe one diphthong, it has been long known that the components in diphthongs do not share the characteristics of their monophthong counterparts and formant movement can be more important than formant onsets and offsets in diphthongs. The observation were confirmed in both acoustics (Lehiste & Peterson 1961; Holbrook & Fairbanks 1962; Gay 1968) and articulation (Tasko & Greilick 2010). It is also mirrored in perception in that formant onset and offset in diphthongs are less prominent than formant movement in identification (Gay 1970). The traditional transcription approach treated diphthongs as composing two segments/targets, but the empirical evidence that formant movement are more important motivates the view that diphthongs are more likely to have one unitary dynamic target than two static targets.

There are some recent studies on the characteristics of English diphthongs. Strycharczuk et al. (2024) investigated the acoustics and articulation of English diphthongs and they showed that there is no categorical distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs. They accounted this observation using two articulatory gestures in both diphthongs and monophthongs. Xu et al. (2025) adopted a different approach and explored the acquisition of English diphthongs by simulation. Their results suggest that one dynamic targets induce more intelligible diphthongs than two static targets. These two recent studies demonstrate a disagreement even deeper than the compositional vs. unitary debate. The disagreement is that different researchers have different definitions of targets. In these two studies, the target in Strycharczuk et al. (2024) is articulatory gestures in articulatory phonology, while the target in Xu et al. (2025) are linear equations with either constant or variable slopes, which is framed within the synchronization hypothesis (Xu 2025).

The present study follows Hu (2013, 2023) and adopts a more empirical approach in deciding whether the components in diphthongs have one or two targets. Hu (2013) suggested that if the components have similar distribution and variability as their monophthong counterparts, then they are believed to have a target of their own. It will be shown later in this study that the change of the corresponding components in diphthongs and monophthongs could also be helpful in indicating whether the speakers treat them as one target or not.

## Southern Min Chinese: An overview of Xiamen and Cangnan Southern Min Chinese

Southern Min Chinese is a branch of Min Chinese dialect, which is mainly spoken in the Fujian province, Taiwan, the southern part of Guangdong province, Hainan province, and southern Zhejiang (Chappell 2019). It is also widely spoken in Chinese communities overseas (Ding 2016). Xiamen southern Min is the representative variety of Southern Min (Luo 1956, Zhou and Ouyang 1998). The other variety, Cangnan is a Southern Min spoken in an exclave in Cangnan, southern Zhejiang (Wen 1991). Previous studies in Chinese dialectology pointed out that Xiamen Min has an accent that is the hybrid of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou southern Min, which is also the case for the southern Min varieties spoken in Taiwan (Zhou 1998:4; Cao 2013; Liu 2020). But Cangnan Min is more similar to Quanzhou Min (Wen 1995). In terms of phonology, Cangnan Min differs from Xiamen mainly in that it has lost the checked tones, while Xiamen also maintain the checked tones with rhymes ending with plosives /p t k/ and glottal stop /ʔ/. There are six monophthongs /i e a ɔ o u/ in Xiamen Min (Luo 1956, Zhou and Ouyang 1998), and nine monophthongs /i e ə ɐ a ɔ o u ɯ/ in Cangnan Min (Wen 1991). The vowel inventories of Xiamen and Cangnan are shown below.

```

In addition to monophthongs, both varieties have diphthongs and triphthongs, as listed in @tbl:diph. Diphthongs can be divided into rising and falling diphthongs, as defined by Hu (2013). Rising diphthongs are those of glides /i u/ and vowel nucleus, and falling diphthongs are those of vowel nucleus and glides /i u/. The diphthongs shared by both varieties are in plain font, and the diphthongs unique to either variety are in boldface. Xiamen and Cangnan Min share five rising diphthongs /ia ua ue iu ui/ and two falling diphthongs /ai au/. Cangnan Min has three rising more diphthongs /ie iɔ uɐ/ and one falling diphthong /əu/ than Xiamen Min, and Xiamen has one rising diphthong /io/ which is not found in Cangnan Min.

: Diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min {#tbl:diph}

The first aim of this study is to investigate the monophthongs and diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min using the approach of Hu (2013, 2023) to investigate whether the diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min are composed of one dynamic or two static targets, using acoustic data. The second aim is to compare the acoustic patterns of Xiamen Min to that of Cangnan Min, in order to investigate whether there are categorical and realizational differences between the two Min varieties.

# Methods

## Participants

For both Xiamen and Cangnan Min, ten native speakers were recruited, and there were five female speakers and five male speakers for each variety. The mean age of the Xiamen speakers was   and that of the Cangnan speakers was 62.4 (sd = 7.7) for male and 50 (sd = 13.6) for female. All of these speakers were native speakers of either Xiamen or Cangnan Min and they reported no speaking or hearing impairments.

## Materials

For both Xiamen and Cangnan Min, two test words were chosen for each monophthong and diphthong. CV syllables were selected for each vowel, and the consonants were preferably plosives /p t k/ or zero onset (i.e., a V syllable). The tone of the test syllable were preferably high level tone. The test words were presented in isolation to the speakers, and they were asked to pronounce it as naturally as possible. The word lists were randomised and each speaker produced five repetitions of each test word. For Xiamen Min, there were 28 ($=2 \text{ words} \times (6 \text{ monophthongs} + 8 \text{ diphthongs})$) test words for each repetition, and $28 \times 5 \text{ repetitions} \times 10 \text{ speakers} = 1400$ syllables in total. There were 40 ($=2 \text{ words} \times (9 \text{ monophthongs} + 11 \text{ diphthongs})$) test words for each repetition, and $40 \times 5 \text{ repetitions} \times 10 \text{ speakers} = 2000$ syllables in total for Cangnan Min. The sounds were recorded into a laptop with a Lexicon I-O 22 sound card and through a SHURE SM86 microphone. The sounds were recorded with a sampling rate of 11025 Hz and digitised at 16 bits.

## Segmentation and analyses

The audio data were manually annotated using Praat (Boersma 2020) and special attention was paid to the vowel. The start of the vowel was determined by the end of the preceding plosive, indicated by the presence of periodic waveform and clear formant structure. The end of the vowel was defined also using the formant structure, indicated by the diminution of F2 and higher formants. For diphthongs, the onset and the offset positions were also labeled for the measurement of formant values.

Formant values were extracted using *Fast Track* (Barreda 2021). *Fast Track* is a formant tracker written in Praat script which carries out multiple Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) in a given segment, within a given frequency interval. The user can specify a range of the highest formant frequency with a minimum and a maximum formant frequency value. For example, if the user specify a range of 4500 to 5000 Hz, *Fast Track* will iterate the range with the frequency range 4500, 4525, 4550, until 5000 Hz with a default step number of 20. It can then select the best analysis from these candidates. To extract the formant  values, we set the lowest analysis frequency as 4500 Hz for female and 5000 Hz for male, the highest analysis frequency to be 6500 Hz for female and 7000 for male, as recommended by Barreda (2021). By inspecting the formant track measured by *Fast Track*, the setting turned out to be effective, except for one male speaker in Xiamen. For this speaker (M4), the lowest analysis frequency was set at 4000 Hz and the highest frequency was 6000 Hz. For the other settings, we set Number of steps as 20, Coefficients of formant as 5, Number of formants as 3, Number of Bins as 5, and Statistic as median.

For both monophthongs and diphthongs, F1 and F2 at eleven equidistant points during the vowel portion were measured. For diphthongs, two additional measurements were made for the onset and offset. The positions of onsets and offsets were manually labeled at the stable portions of onsets and offsets. The values at the 6th point during the vowel interval were taken as the target formant values of monophthongs, which were used for visualization and the comparison between onsets and offsets of diphthongs.

# Results

The following sections present the results of monophthongs (3.1) and diphthongs (3.2). The results focus on the spectral properties of monophthongs and diphthongs. The reason is that spectral properties best reveals the patterns in Xiamen and Cangnan Min. As for temporal organization of diphthongs, considerable individual differences were found within each variety, and a detailed discussion requires a dedicated study. Due to space limitations, more figures, including those showing formant trajectories, can be accessed in the GitHub repository for this study.

## Monophthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min

The distributions of monophthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min are shown in @fig:mono. The lower panels show the monophthongs of Cangnan Min and the upper panels show that of Xiamen Min. The data of female speakers were on the left, and those of male speakers were on the right. For both Xiamen and Cangnan Min, they have a triangular monophthong system, in that the low vowel /a/ does not make a distinction in vowel height. However, they differ in the number of levels they distinguish in both vowel height and backness. Xiamen Min has two levels in vowel backness, and three levels in vowel height. It distinguishes the high vowels /i/ and /u/, and the mid vowels /a o ɔ/. It is worth noting that although /o/ and /ɔ/ have the contrast in vowel height in transcription, the contrast in the acoustic vowel diagram indicates that their contrast is in vowel backness. The vowel /o/ is in the mid central position, and /ɔ/ in the mid back position. This constitutes the three-way contrast in the mid dimension of the Xiamen monophthong system, and furthermore, it reveals a sound change in Xiamen Min, which parallels a well-documented vowel sound change in Taiwan Southern Min. This sound change will be discussed further in the discussion together with its implications for the targets of the corresponding diphthong /io/. Thus, Xiamen Min shows a balanced triangular monophthong system.

![Monophthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min](/Users/chunyu/Desktop/min-vowel/02analysis/figure/monophthong.png){#fig:mono width=40%}

Despite the triangular pattern of monophthongs in Cangnan Min, it is less balanced than that in Xiamen Min. For both high and mid-high vowels, Cangnan Min has a three-way contrast, distinguishing /i ɯ a/ in high vowels and /e ə o/ in mid-high vowels. But for mid-low vowels, there is only a two-way contrast, distinguishing only the mid-low central vowel /ɐ/ and the mid-low back vowel /ɔ/. The mid-low front position is empty. It is in this regard that the monophthong system of Cangnan Min is less balanced than that of Xiamen Min. This imbalance resembles the vowel system of Quanzhou Min (Lin 2008). However, this *prima facie* imbalance ceases to exist if diphthongs are taken into account, which will be presented in the next section. Another point of Cangnan monophthongs is that the vowel /ɯ/ takes the high central position, in spite of the transcription as a unrounded high back vowel (Hu and Ge 2016).

In terms of monophthongs, Xiamen and Cangnan Min both show a triangular system, but they differ in the number of contrasts in both vowel height and backness, and the most noteworthy difference is the more balanced distribution in Xiamen Min than the less balanced one in Cangnan Min.

## Diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min

In this section, the results of rising and falling diphthongs are presented separately.

### Rising diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min

There are five common rising diphthongs /ia ua ue iu ui/ between Xiamen and Cangnan Min. Xiamen Min has one rising diphthongs /io/ which is not found in Cangnan Min, but Cangnan Min has three other rising diphthongs than Xiamen /iɔ ie uɐ/. In general, Cangnan Min is similar to Xiamen Min in the inventory of rising diphthongs, in spite of the three more monophthongs in Cangnan Min. @fig:rising displays the distributions of the onsets and offsets of all the rising diphthongs in both varieties, along with their monophthong counterparts. The three cardinal vowels were also included in all the plots in order to show the vowel space for reference. In @fig:rising, the panel A shows the diphthongs /iu ui/, which are found in both Xiamen and Cangnan Min. The same goes for the diphthongs /ia ua/ in @fig:rising(C). In @fig:rising(B), /ue/ is in both varieties, and /ue/ is only in Cangnan Min, which is plotted in the upper panel. In @fig:rising(D), the upper panel shows the two diphthongs /iɔ uɐ/ in Cangnan Min, and /io/ in Xiamen Min.

For the rising diphthongs /iu ui/ in @fig:rising(A), both the onsets and offsets of the two diphthongs almost fully overlaps with the corresponding monophthongs /i/ and /u/, and they also exhibit similar variance as indicated by the size of the ellipses. These observations are true for both varieties. That is to say that the speakers from both varieties maintain the characteristics of the monophthong counterparts of the onsets and offsets in the diphthongs /iu ui/ very well. It indicates that the onsets and offsets share the same target as monophthongs, and in other words, there are two targets for the rising diphthongs /iu ui/ for both Xiamen and Cangnan Min.

![The distribution of the onsets and offsets of rising diphthongs together with their monophthong counterparts: A. /iu ui/, B. /ie ue/ in Cangnan and /ue/ in Xiamen, C. /ia ua/, D. /iɔ uɐ/ in Cangnan and /io/ in Xiamen](/Users/chunyu/Desktop/min-vowel/02analysis/figure/rising.png){#fig:rising width=100%}

The same is true for the rising diphthongs /io/ in Xiamen Min and /iɔ uɐ/ in Cangnan Min, as shown in @fig:rising(B). For all three diphthongs, their onsets and offsets align well with their monophthong counterparts in that they appear in the same positions as the monophthongs and they have similar degrees of variance. This suggests that these three diphthongs also have two separate targets, which are identical with the monophthong counterparts of the onsets and offsets.

In @fig:rising(C), the offsets of /ia ua/ also almost completely overlaps with the monophthong /a/ in both Xiamen and Cangnan Min. For the onsets, the positions of /i u/ of /ia ua/ in Xiamen Min are nearly identical to those of the monophthongs, but in Cangnan Min, they are lower than the monophthongs. At the same time, while the onsets in Xiamen Min have large degree of overlap with the monophthongs, the overlap is considerably lower for Cangnan Min. What is common between the two varieties, nevertheless, is that the onsets are similar to the monophthongs in terms of variance. It can be said that there are also two separate targets for /ia ua/ in Xiamen and Cangnan Min, but unlike in /iu ui/ and /io iɔ uɐ/, the two varieties differ in phonetic realization. The onsets /i u/ in Cangnan Min are subject to the anticipatory coarticulation of the following /a/, which drags the positions of the onsets towards the offset /a/. In phonetic realization, the onset targets of /ia ua/ in Xiamen Min are less amenable to articulation as compared to those in Cangnan Min. 

The rising diphthongs /ie ue/ in @fig:rising(D) are more complex than the other rising diphthongs. First of all, in phonological terms, both Xiamen and Cangnan Min have monophthongs /i u e/, but Xiamen Min only has /ue/, while Cangnan Min has both /ue/ and /ie/. In terms of spectral properties, the onset /u/ of /ue/ in Xiamen Min has a large portion of overlap with the monophthong /u/, and the overlap is considerably less in Cangnan Min with a lower position of the onset in the vowel space than the monophthong. The situation is similar with the onsets of /ia ua/. As for the offset /e/ in /ue/, it overlaps with the monophthong /e/ in Xiamen Min, but it has a larger variance. This larger variance indicates that the offset target of /ue/ in Xiamen Min can range from [e] to [æ] in its phonetic realization, since the variance is in area between /i/ and /a/. If we hypothesize that, on the other hand, the offset /e/ of /ue/ in Xiamen Min does not have a target of its own, the variance would be towards the direction of its onset /u/, which is not what we observed. Therefore, /ue/ in Xiamen Min still has two separate targets, in spite of the larger variance of its offset. In the other variety, both the onsets and the offsets of the diphthongs /ie ue/ in Cangnan Min have comparable variance with their monophthong counterparts. A more notable feature is that the offset /e/ in /ue/ and the offset /e/ in /ie/ do not overlap in their distributions, with the former nearer to the monophthong /e/ than the latter. The offset /e/ in /ie/ occupies just the empty area in-between the monophthongs /e/ and /a/. These three diphthongs also have two separate targets. The additional diphthong /ie/ in Cangnan Min as compared to Xiamen Min will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.2, in the light of the whole vowel system.

### Falling diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min

The distributions of the onsets and offsets of the falling diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min are shown in @fig:falling, in the same manner as rising diphthongs in @fig:rising. For falling diphthongs, Xiamen and Cangnan Min share two common diphthongs /ai au/, and Cangnan Min has an additional /əu/. In @fig:falling(A), the onsets of /ai au/ have the same target position and distribution as the monophthong /a/, which is the same as the offsets of /ia ua/, for both Xiamen and Cangnan Min. It indicates that the onsets of the falling diphthongs /ai au/ resembles the offsets of the rising diphthongs /ia ua/ in sharing the targets of the monophthong /a/. However, what is different between the falling diphthongs and the rising diphthongs is that the distributions of the offsets /i u/ of /ai au/ are considerably larger than the monophthongs /i u/. Moreover, the offsets does not reach the positions of the corresponding monophthongs. Therefore, the offsets /i u/ of /ai au/ have different target properties from the onsets /i u/ of /ia iu/. In terms of spectral properties, the offsets /i u/ of /ai au/ have more variable realizations and are more subject to the carryover articulatory effects of the preceding /a/. It suggests that the offsets of /ai au/ do not have a specific target, and the distinctive feature of these diphthongs is their dynamic properties from the onset /a/ to different directions in the vowel space. Apart from these common characteristics, Xiamen and Cangnan Min have a difference in phonetic realization. The degree of undershoot resulting from carryover articulation is larger for Cangnan Min than for Xiamen Min. It is reminiscent of the same difference observed in the onsets of /ia iu/.

![The distribution of the onsets and offsets of falling diphthongs together with their monophthong counterparts: A. /ai au/ in Xiamen and Cangnan Min, B. /əu/ in Cangnan Min](/Users/chunyu/Desktop/min-vowel/02analysis/figure/falling.png){#fig:falling}

In @fig:falling(B), the falling diphthong /əu/ in Cangnan Min has larger distribution for both its onset and offset, as compared to the corresponding monophthongs. The onsets and offsets are close together, which indicates that the falling vowel /əu/ should be characterised as having a dynamic target, rather than two separate static targets.

### The difference between rising and falling diphthongs as measured by Pillai score

To better investigate the overlap between the diphthong onsets and offsets and their monophthong counterparts, the overlap was calculated using Pillai score. Pillai score was first introduced by Pillai (1955). Pillai score measures the overlap of two distributions. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with that near 0 meaning more overlap and that near 1 indicating less overlap. Pillai score is widely used in studying vowel merger (Hay, Warren and Drager 2006, Nycz and Hall-Lew 2014), ever since Hay et al. (2006) introduced this measurement to the study of the merger between the *NEAR* /iə/ and *SQUARE* /eə/ vowels in New Zealand English. Although there are other vowel overlap measurements, Kelley and Tucker (2020) showed that Pillai score is more accurate than the others. Stanley and Sneller (2023) also showed that sample size matters in Pillai score.

![Pillai scores measuring the overlap of the distribution between onsets/offsets of diphthongs with their monophthong counterparts](/Users/chunyu/Desktop/min-vowel/02analysis/figure/pillai.png){#fig:pillai width=80%}

In the present study, Pillai scores were calculated with the raw formant data, since normalization does not change the value of Pillai scores (Stanley 2021). Pillai scores were calculated for the pair of the onsets or offsets of diphthongs and their monophthong counterparts. For example, the diphthong /ai/ have /a/ as its onset and /i/ as its offset. Pillai scores can be calculated for the pair of the onset /a/ in /ai/ and the monophthong /a/, as well as for the pair of the offset /i/ in /ai/ and the monophthong /i/. Pillai scores were calculated between the pairs for each speaker. Therefore, for each pair, there are ten values of Pillai scores for each variety. The values of Pillai scores for all the pairs of the onsets/offsets and their monophthong counterparts in both Xiamen and Cangnan Min are shown in @fig:pillai. In the figure, the left panel is the pairs of onsets and their corresponding monophthongs, and the right panel is the pairs of offsets and the corresponding monophthongs. To illustrate the difference between rising and falling diphthongs, those pairs involving components in falling diphthongs are in red and those involving components in rising diphthongs are in blue. Each pair is indicated in the x-axis, in the format "a-a(i)", as the same manner in @fig:rising and @fig:falling. The label "a-a(i)" means the pair of the monophthong /a/ and the onset /a/ in /ai/.

There are some overlap in the range of Pillai scores for rising and falling diphthongs. For both Xiamen and Cangnan Min, the onset /a/ in the falling diphthongs /ai/ and /au/ have similar Pillai scores as the offset /a/ in the rising diphthongs /ia/ and /ua/ (the first two columns in the right and the left panels). Linear mixed-effects models were constructed with diphthong type (rising vs. falling) and diphthong (ia vs. ua vs. ai vs. au) as fixed effects and the speaker as random intercept. Fixed effects were stepwise added to the model. Model comparison indicates that the inclusion of diphthong type did not improve the model fit significantly ($\chi^2(1)=2.80, p=0.09$ for Xiamen Min, $\chi^2(1)=0.05, p=0.82$ for Cangnan Min). This means that the overlap of the onset /a/ in /ai au/ and the monophthong /a/ is not significantly different from the overlap of the offset /a/ in /ia iu/ for both Xiamen and Cangnan Min.

However, the offsets in falling diphthongs are generally higher in Pillai score than all other components in both rising and falling diphthongs. For both Xiamen and Cangnan Min, the offset /i/ in the falling diphthong /ai/ have higher Pillai score than the onset /i/ in the rising diphthong /ia/. The inclusion of diphthong type significantly improves model fit ($\chi^2(1)=5.49, p=0.019$ for Xiamen Min, $\chi^2(1)=7.90, p=0.005$ for Cangnan Min). The offset /i/ in /ai/ is 0.17 higher than the onset /i/ in /ia/ in Pillai score for Cangnan Min, and the difference is 0.21 for Xiamen Min. But for the falling diphthong /au/, only in Xiamen Min is the offset /u/ in /au/ has significantly higher Pillai score than the onset /u/ in /au/ ($\chi^2(1)=4.10, p=0.043$), which is not significant for Cangnan Min ($\chi^2(1)=0.42, p=0.51$). This is due to the undershoot of the offset /u/ in /au/ in Cangnan Min. Apart from /ai au/, there is an additional falling diphthong /əu/ in Cangnan Min. Since there is no corresponding rising diphthong /uə/ to compare with, it is not clear whether the overlap of the components in the falling diphthong /əu/ and the corresponding monophthong is higher than that between the components in rising diphthongs and the monophthongs. Nevertheless, the Pillai score between /ə/ in /əu/ and the monophthong /ə/ is relatively high, and is only slightly lower than that between /i/ in /ai/ and /i/. On the contrary, the Pillai score between /u/ in /əu/ and the monophthong /u/ is relatively low, which is still significantly higher than the offset /u/ in /iu/.

To take rising and falling diphthongs together, it is clear that almost all offset components in falling diphthongs /ai au/ have higher Pillai scores than other components. It indicates that the offsets in falling diphthongs /ai au/ have less overlap with the corresponding monophthongs compared to other components in diphthongs. Therefore, the falling diphthongs /ai au/ in both Xiamen and Cangnan Min can be treated as having a dynamic target starting from the monophthong /a/ towards different directions in the vowel space. As for the falling diphthongs /əu/, it is more likely to have a dynamic target with a relatively stable end point towards /u/, but its starting point is more variable.

Although Pillai score can measure the overlap between the onsets/offsets in diphthongs and their corresponding monophthongs, it can be influenced by coarticulatory effects such as undershoot. The clearest cases are the onsets /i/ and /u/ in the rising diphthongs /ia ua/ in Cangnan Min. In spite of the fact that these onsets have dense distribution comparable as their monophthong counterparts shown in @fig:rising(C), they have little overlap with the monophthongs, even in the same order as offsets /i u/ in falling diphthongs /ai au/. The same is true for the onset /u/ in the rising diphthong /ue/ in Cangnan Min. On the other hand, this is found in Xiamen Min, which is in accordance with the observation that these onsets have less undershoot than those in Cangnan Min. That being said, Pillai score can be used as a useful heuristic for characterising the characteristics of onsets and offsets in diphthongs. A rough demarcation can be drawn at 0.75, above which are values between those more variable components and the monophthongs (together with those with severe undershoot), and below which are those components which share the same distribution as the monophthongs.

# Discussion

## The sound change of /o/ in Xiamen Min

In 3.1, it is observed that the mid-high back vowel /o/ in Xiamen Min is similar to /ɔ/ in terms of F1, and their contrast is not in vowel height, but more likely on lip rounding, with /o/ occupies the unrounded position of mid-low vowel. This discrepancy between the transcription and the acoustic data suggests a vowel change in Xiamen Min. That is, the vowel /o/ lowered and fronted, and as a result, the contrast in the mid-low vowel height increases from two (/e/ vs. /ɔ/) to three (/e/ vs. /o/ vs. /ɔ/). The literature provides some evidence for this sound change. Previous descriptions of Xiamen Min have pointed out that the vowel /o/ was produced the same as the unrounded [ɤ] (Ji 2008:13, Liu 2016). Furthermore, the corresponding vowels in other Southern Min varieties with the vowel /o/ in Xiamen Min are also sometimes transcribed as /ɤ/ (Zhang 1989 on Tainan Min).

Studies in Southern Min varieties spoken in Taiwan also documented similar vowel change of the vowel /o/. Taipei Min used to have the same vowel system as Xiamen Min, but Chen (2010) observed that there is a tendency for some Taipei Min speakers to distinguish /o ɔ/ not by vowel height, but by lip rounding instead. Tainan Southern Min has six vowels as Xiamen Min, and the vowel /o/ has also changed to a mid vowel /ə/. The distribution of /o/ in the vowel space of Tainan Min is almost identical to that we observed in Xiamen Min (see the acoustic vowel charts on pages 416 and 417 in Liu 2020). Liu (2020) also reported the same vowel change in Xinzhu Min. It is obvious that Xiamen Min undergoes a parallel reorganization of the vowel system as that found in varieties in Taiwan Southern Min (Chen 2010, Liu 2020, Chen 2023).

The change of /o/ of Xiamen Min has an important implication for the characteristics of rising diphthongs in Xiamen Min. In Xiamen Min, there is a rising diphthong /io/ which takes the monophthong /o/ as its offset element. Although there is no horizontal study on the diachronic change of /io/, but given the well-documented change of /o/, it is very likely that the offset of /io/ shared the earlier characteristics of /o/ as being a half-low back vowel. When the monophthong /o/ undergoes a sound change, if /o/ in the diphthong /io/ and the monophthong /o/ have different targets, the former would tend to show some difference than the latter. However, what we observe is that /o/ in /io/ highly overlaps with its monophthong counterpart, as shown in @fig:rising. In other words, the offset of /io/ undergoes the same sound change as the monophthong /o/. It suggests that the offset /o/ in /io/ has the same target as the monophthong /o/. This lends another piece of evidence to the argument that rising diphthongs in Xiamen Min have two static targets.

## The diphthong /ie/ in Cangnan

In Cangnan Min, there is a four-way contrast in both central and back vowels, which is only missing in front vowels, and there are only three front vowels /i e a/. In Xiamen Min, however, there is a three-way contrast in both front and back dimensions, according to our discussion in the previous section. Therefore, unlike that in Xiamen Min, the monophthong system in Cangnan Min is unbalanced in front vowels. This difference in the distribution of monophthongs can account for the variation of diphthongs in Xiamen and Cangnan Min. The two varieties both have the diphthong /ue/, but the variance of the offset /e/ is larger in Xiamen than in Cangnan Min. Moreover, there is another rising diphthong /ie/ with the offset /e/ in Cangnan Min, which does not appear in Xiamen Min. If the diphthongs /ie ue/ are plotted together with the front vowels /i e a/, the pattern becomes clear, as in @fig:rising(D). Although the offsets of /ie ue/ are both transcribed using /e/, their distributions in the vowel space barely overlap, and there is a tendency for the offset /e/ in /ie/ to be more variable than the /e/ in /ue/ (which is more obvious for female speakers). The position of /e/ in /ie/ appears between the monophthongs /e a/ and it occupies a missing monophthong that should have been there to create a four-way contrast as in mid and back vowels. In other words, the unbalanced monophthong system in Cangnan Min is complemented by the offset /e/ in the rising diphthong /ie/. This also explains the more variable distribution of the offset /e/ in /ue/ in Xiamen, since there is no such restriction and there is only a three-way contrast in the vowel height dimension. It is perhaps not coincidental that /ie/ appears only in Cangnan Min but not in Xiamen Min, which could be restricted by the monophthong system. In short, this means that Cangnan Min has a four-way contrast in the vowel height dimension for front vowels as well as for mid and back vowels, but the mid-low front vowel only surfaces in the offset of the rising diphthong /ie/.

This finding has some typological implications. Hu (2023) proposed that falling diphthongs can complement the monophthong system as dynamic vowels, based on the data from Hangzhou Wu and Taiyuan Jin Chinese. In this study, we found that in the rising diphthong /ie/ in Cangnan Min, the offset complements the position of [ɛ], which is missing in the monophthong system. This suggests that the gaps in the monophthong system can also appear in the vowel components in rising diphthongs, in addition to those in falling diphthongs. But there is also a difference. While falling diphthongs constitute a dynamic unit, which complements the monophthong system, in Cangnan Min, only the offset of the rising diphthong occupies the gap in the monophthong system.

## The differences in phonetic realization of vowels between Xiamen and Cangnan  Min

The most notable difference between Xiamen and Cangnan Min in phonetic realization of vowels, especially of diphthongs, is that coarticulatory effects is stronger in Cangnan Min than in Xiamen Min. The onsets /i/ and /u/ in diphthongs /ia ua ue/ have clear undershoot in Cangnan Min, which is less so for Xiamen Min. This is evident in @fig:rising(C) and the Pillai scores in @fig:pillai. It is well-known that coarticulation can be different in different languages, and one of the most prominent explanation is that coarticulation is constrained by the system of contrast in a language (see reviews in Manuel 1999 and Zellou 2022). However, the difference in phonological contrasts is unlikely to be the cause of the coarticulatory difference between Xiamen and Cangnan Min. Xiamen Min has a three-way contrast in vowel height, while Cangnan Min has a four-way contrast. The coarticulation should be larger in Xiamen Min than in Cangnan Min if the aim is to maintain phonological contrasts, as predicted by Manuel and Krakow (1984). Of course, if the /ia ua/ in Cangnan Min is transcribed as /ea oa/, the coarticulatory difference would evaporate, but it gives rise to more complexity in the phonological system in that /e a/ can also be the onsets of rising diphthongs.

A more convincing explanation is that the coarticulatory difference between Xiamen and Cangnan Min could be due to language contact. Unlike Xiamen Min, which is in a purely Min dialect surroundings, Cangnan Min is located in an area with many Wu Chinese varieties. Not coincidentally, there is also clear undershoot of the onsets /i u/ in rising diphthongs /ia ua/ in several Wu Chinese, such as Ningbo Wu (Hu 2013) and Hangzhou Wu (Yue and Hu 2018; Hu 2023). It is very likely that Cangnan Min exhibits more degrees of coarticulation due to its contact with Wu Chinese.

<!--Although Pillai score can be used to measure the overlap between two vowel distributions, it is shown to be sensitive to sample size (Stanley and Sneller 2023). A more serious question remains uninvestigated, that is, Pillai score does not take the variation of the two distributions into account. As a consequence, it is unable to differentiable the cases of one vowel enlarging its distribution to include another vowel and the two vowels approach together and merge in distribution. Therefore, although Pillai score provides important heuristics in investigating vowel merger and possibly vowel systems, there remains to be unsolved questions.-->
